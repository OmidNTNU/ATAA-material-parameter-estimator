Hi!
Use this tool to find material parameters in acordance with Holzapfel et al. model (2015) for the aneurysmal and healthy aortic wall in the ascending thorasic aorta based on its region. regions are devided into anterior, posterior, major, and minor. see this figure to locate the regions on an explanted ascending aorta from an aneurysm patient.
![Regions on an explanted ascending thoracic aorta - different region on the longitudinal axis on the major curve are not differentitated to adhear to the dataset published by Cosentino et al.](fullATAA.png)
Dataset for the parameters can be found in Cosentino et al. (2023) and Ghorbani et al. (2025).
